Hello World!

What's life without the many trials and tribulations that we get hit with? Boring, I would say. I love challenges and learning new things whether I regret it when it gets tough, but I push through and see bumps and cuts as lessons. 

A child of the 90s I grew up with AOL messenger/chat, World wide web, emails and checking to see if someone was using the landline (what's a landline, lol!) so you won't have issues accessing the internet was all new. Seems like so long ago but it's definitely shaped our world today. I'm very new to coding but it's always pique my interest. I could remember always wondering who's running this website, who's making all this happen. 

I've ventured into other careers and although they've challenged me I always felt like I stopped learning. I decided to study Software Engineering because I've never lost fascination with just how all these things work.  You learn new things, investigate what's not working and try to figure it out. All the things that I love, a challenge which it's been so far and investigating while learning something new that may change tomorrow.
